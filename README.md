# 👋 Hey there, I'm Vivek Balmiki!  

## 🚀 About Me  
I'm a **Data Science enthusiast** who talks to data more than people (because data always makes sense, right?).  
Currently **learning Machine Learning algorithms** and figuring out how to make computers think like humans—without them taking over the world.  

🔍 **What I Do?**  
- Dig through messy datasets like a detective on a case.  
- Make dashboards that (hopefully) don’t put you to sleep.  
- Train ML models that sometimes behave better than my Wi-Fi.

## 🛠️ Skills & Technologies  

💻 **Programming & Data Science:**  
- Python (where I tell pandas and NumPy what to do)  
- Power BI & Tableau (because visuals > spreadsheets)  
- Machine Learning, Feature Engineering, and trying not to overfit models  

🌍 **Web Development (aka my side quest):**  
- MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)  
- Flask (when I want to mix Python with web magic)  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (the building blocks of the internet)

## 🎯 Currently Learning  
- **Machine Learning Algorithms** (because "AI overlord" sounds cool)
- **Advanced Data Visualization** (turning numbers into eye candy)  
- **Power BI** (because dashboards make data storytelling fun)
